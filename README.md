# AuthenScan â€“ Invoice and Transaction Fraud Detection

**AuthenScan** is a fraud detection web application that combines image forgery detection and transaction anomaly detection. It uses machine learning and deep learning models to help detect:
- Forged or tampered invoice images
- Fraudulent banking transactions

---

## Features

### Invoice Forgery Detection
Detects visually manipulated or fake invoice scans using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on ELA (Error Level Analysis) images.

- Upload an invoice image in `.jpg` or `.png` format
- The app uses ELA to preprocess the image
- The CNN model classifies the image as:
  - Real
  - Forged

Use Case: Verifying scanned invoices before processing in financial or enterprise systems.

### Bank Transaction Fraud Detection
Detects suspicious or fake bank transactions using a trained machine learning model on real financial transaction datasets.

Input fields:
- Sender Account ID
- Receiver Account ID
- Transaction Amount
- Transaction Type (e.g., NEFT, IMPS)
- Transaction Status (Success/Failed)
- Device Used (Mobile/Desktop)
- PIN Code

Model output:
- Legitimate transaction
- Fraudulent transaction

---

### Email Alert System
- If a transaction is flagged as fraudulent, the system sends an alert email to the registered user.
